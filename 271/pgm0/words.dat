     Once you begin intensive reading it will be necessary to take notes. The
 results of your preliminary reading may be carried in your head, but you are
 now beginning to collect the actual evidence from which your paper will be
 written, and it is important to the success of all the rest of your work that
 both the form and the content of your notes be satisfactory.
     All notes should be written on cards and should contain two kinds of
 information: the fact or opinion being noted, and the exact source from which
 you took it.  The second item is absolutely necessary, since you will be
 required to identify the sources of your material in the footnotes of your
 paper.
     Usually that means you must identify the author, title, and page of the
 book or article from which the note was taken.  Here is a typical note made
 from a book:
    NOTE  NOTE   NOTE   NOTE NOTES  more NOTES
 If you are making a number of notes from the same source, the complete
 identification given above may be abbreviated.
     Only one note should be placed on a card.  It is wise to leave enough
 space at the top of each card so that you may write in a subject heading
 when you group your cards and develop your outline.  Because these subject
 headings may be changed as your organization develops, it is wise to enter 
 them in pencil.
     This paragraph is not related to the above paragraphs.  I propose to
 consider the question, Can machines think?  This should begin with
 definitions of the meaning of the terms machine and think.  The definitions
 might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the
 words, but this attitude is dangerous.
     The stories of man and of his machines are inseparably woven together.
 Machines have enabled man to transform his physical environment.  With their
 aid he has plowed the land and built cities and dug great canals.  These
 transformations of man's habitat have necessarily
 induced mutations in his societal arrangements.  But even more critically,
 the machines of man have strongly determined his very understanding of his
 world and hence of himself.  Man is
 conscious of himself, of the existence of others like himself, and of a
 world that is, to
 some extent, malleable.  Most importantly, man can foresee.
