	We study data structures so that we may learn to write more efficient programs. But
 why must programs be efficient when new computers are faster every year?  This is not enough. 
 The reason is that our ambitions grow with our capabilites. Instead of rendering 
 efficiency needs obsolete, the modern revolution in computer power and storage capability
 merely raises the efficiency stakes as we computerize more complex tasks.

	A data structures course offers a good opportunity to introduce the concepts
associated with object oriented programming.  C++ is a good language for this purpose.
It is a major language gaining in popularity.  Second, the student gets to see concrete
examples of object oriented programming in use.  Abstract data types are introduced in such a 
course.  Efficient data structure implementations are also examined.  Students learn lots of 
stuff in this course. Once mastered, C++ is a very powerful tool to generate generalized programs.
