Program 3 : B+tree
                     What do you need to do?


files: create.cc   insert.cc  payroll.cc  TREE.250
       typedefs.h  random.h   btree.h     KEYS.250
   (1) do nothing; do not alter these files


file btree.cc
   (1) function Find
   (2) function Insert
   (3) function Sequential
   remember: there is no data[i] field for the B+tree


file bt.cc
   (1) function btreeInsert


file disk.cc
   (1) printIndexFilePage0()
   (2) printDataFilePage0 ()


file Makefile
   (1) put "your" name(s) after "Written by: " at target test



                 What do you use that I have given you?

(1) treeprint
    executable file treeprint will create a level-order traversal
    of the Index File (Index Set & Sequence Set)  (see the Makefile)
    usage:  treeprint btree.bin


(2) bt.obj
    object file bt.obj is the compiled version of the private member
    function btreeInsert.  btreeInsert performs a btree insert,
    which is what you need to do in the Index Set of the B+tree.

(3) Go
    A Shell script for testing, e.g.  Go 1
