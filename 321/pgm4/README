README

1.  make only one change to main.cc
    replace
           logf << "Written by: Andrew Perrie" << endl << endl;
    with
           logf << "Written by:  your name(s)" << endl << endl;

2.  You may not change the API described in bufferpool.h and pool.h

3.  You must use private member functions isBuffered, writeToDisk
       and moveToFront
    You may delete private member function insertIntoBufferPool
    You may add more private member functions

4.  You may not use the number 16 anywhere in pool.cc
    you may not use struct record anywhere in pool.cc

5.  You must create a Makefile
       use macros
       you should use the macro    "OBJ = main.o pool.o showHex.obj"
       main.o and pool.o need to be created
       the link step needs showHex.obj
       showHex.obj is precompiled; it is only linked
       the executable must be named "bman"  (buffer manager)
       create a target (clean) to delete all ".o" files
       create a target (erase) to delete all ".o" files and bman

6.  C++
    Consider the following code:
    char *s;
    s = new char[80];
    char *x;
    x = s + 20;   // x is the "address" of s[20]
    x[0] is s[20]

7.  Suppose a logical record is 4 bytes
    Suppose a frame holds 5 logical records; then frameSize = 20 bytes
    Suppose you request the logical record at fileOffset 28
    Then, you need to compute "baseOffset = 20;" and
    do a "seekg(baseOffset);" to get the block of 5 records that
    contains the requested record (the 8th record in the file)
