Yesterday,
 All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
 Now my database has gone away.
 Oh I believe in yesterday.
    
Suddenly,
 There is not half the files there used to be,
 And there is a milestone hanging over me
 The system crashed so suddenly.
 I pushed something wrong
 What it was I could not say.
 Now all my data is gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.
    
Yesterday,
 The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
 I knew my data was all here to stay,
 Now I believe in yesterday.
We don't need no education 
We don't need no thought control 
No dark sarcasm in the classroom 
Teachers leave the kids alone 
Hey, teacher leave the kids alone! 
All in all it's just another brick in the wall 
All in all you're just another brick in the wall 
We don't need no education 
We don't need no thought control 
No dark sarcasm in the classroom 
Teachers leave the kids alone 
Hey, teacher leave the kids alone! 
All in all it's just another brick in the wall 
All in all you're just another brick in the wall 
We don@t need no education 
we don@t need no thought control 
no dark sarcasm in the classroom 
teacher leave those kids alone 
hey teacher leave those kids alone 
all in all your just 
another brick in the wall...
